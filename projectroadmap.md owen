First I would like to personally critique the code to my liking
Figure out the movement of the paddle and enhance it
Create a new look to the game, but keep it a classic look
My teammate Greg Allen will further inspect the code and make changes as well
Made the paddle bigger and made movement quicker (greg)
Changed the background color 
Binded "A" and "D" keys as left and right input as well.
Made the ball into a different shape.
